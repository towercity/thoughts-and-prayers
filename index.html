                Thoughts & Prayers – the title of which invokes the phrase synonymous with complacency in the face of preventable disaster – explores America’s relationship with tragedy, catastrophe, and hope. The hour-long show, divided into five acts, follows a fictitious couple Dana and Felix as they find themselves facing various cataclysms – global, nationwide, local, and domestic. The piece also features musicians (three strings, three woodwinds) who engage in fully-staged theatrical performance as two Greek choruses: The Congress and The Activists  –  and comment on the daily hum of media coverage while clashing over political failures and widening gaps of partisanship and class.

                Thoughts & Prayers employs Hlubny’s trademark method of approaching the musicians as full actors: as she did in sans (2017) and her previous work developed with the acclaimed saxophonist and composer Thomas Giles.Their first joint project, The Stranger (2017), had the instrumentalist moving, dancing, and doing scene-work along with the dancer. The newest production takes their collaboration to the next level, further developing the process of creation of a music-driven physical performance which both artists compare to writing an opera. “My point of departure was almost like writing a libretto, except it was not just text: I presented Thomas with a narrative consisting of specific prompts which he in turn transformed into music,” explains Hlubny. Giles adds: “A lot of material needed to be substantially reworked in the context of the narrative, and there was no room for being too precious about my own ideas.”

                The narrative layer was inspired in large part by actual events that happened during the piece’s gestation period, such as the massacres at Parkland and in Las Vegas; a personal family tragedy; Hurricane Maria; the Flint Water Crisis. “Every project I undertake has to have a socio-political mission, and Thoughts & Prayers is partnering with community organizations with similar objectives. We have to understand that over 80% of the experience of the show is coming from the audiences’ lives out there in the real world,” says Hlubny, whose previous work dealt with concepts such as social justice and gender equality.
